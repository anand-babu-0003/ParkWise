# CRUD Operations Fix Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the fixes made to resolve CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations issues in the admin panel and owner dashboard.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Admin Panel CRUD Issues
- The admin panel was calling update and delete operations with incorrect URL patterns
- The MongoDB hook functions were not properly handling error responses
- The user interface was not providing clear feedback on operation success/failure

### 2. Owner Dashboard CRUD Issues
- The owner dashboard was not properly handling API response errors
- Form validation was missing for numeric fields
- State management for editing forms had issues

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Admin Panel Fixes

#### Updated API Call Patterns
- Changed from calling `/api/users` for all operations to:
  - GET: `/api/users` (list all users)
  - POST: `/api/users` (create new user)
  - PUT: `/api/users/{id}` (update specific user)
  - DELETE: `/api/users/{id}` (delete specific user)

#### Improved Error Handling
- Enhanced the MongoDB hook functions to provide better error messages
- Added proper error logging for debugging
- Improved the UI to show operation status

#### Code Changes
- Modified `src/app/admin/users/page.tsx` to properly call API endpoints with IDs
- Updated `src/lib/mongodb.ts` to improve error handling and feedback

### 2. Owner Dashboard Fixes

#### API Call Improvements
- Added proper error handling for all API calls
- Improved response handling with better error messages
- Added validation for numeric form fields

#### Form State Management
- Fixed state management issues in the edit form
- Improved form field handling for numeric values
- Added proper initialization of form fields

#### Code Changes
- Modified `src/app/mobile-owner-dashboard.tsx` to properly handle API responses
- Added better error handling and user feedback

## Testing the Fixes

### Admin Panel Testing
1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard
2. Go to the Users section
3. Try adding a new user:
   - Click "Add New User" button
   - Fill in user details
   - Click "Add User"
   - Verify the user appears in the list
4. Try editing a user:
   - Click the edit icon for a user
   - Modify user details
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Verify the changes are reflected
5. Try deleting a user:
   - Click the delete icon for a user
   - Confirm deletion
   - Verify the user is removed from the list

### Owner Dashboard Testing
1. Log in as an owner user
2. Navigate to the Owner Dashboard
3. Try adding a new parking lot:
   - Click "Add Lot" button
   - Fill in lot details
   - Click "Add Lot"
   - Verify the lot appears in the list
4. Try editing a parking lot:
   - Click the edit icon for a lot
   - Modify lot details
   - Click "Update Lot"
   - Verify the changes are reflected
5. Try deleting a parking lot:
   - Click the delete icon for a lot
   - Confirm deletion
   - Verify the lot is removed from the list

## API Endpoint Structure

### User Management Endpoints
- `GET /api/users` - List all users
- `POST /api/users` - Create a new user
- `PUT /api/users/{id}` - Update a specific user
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}` - Delete a specific user

### Parking Lot Management Endpoints
- `GET /api/owner/lots?ownerId={id}` - List all lots for an owner
- `POST /api/owner/lots` - Create a new lot for an owner
- `PUT /api/owner/lots/{id}` - Update a specific lot
- `DELETE /api/owner/lots/{id}` - Delete a specific lot

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "User not found" Error
- **Cause**: Incorrect user ID being passed to the API
- **Solution**: Verify the user ID exists and is correctly formatted

### 2. "Failed to add/update/delete" Error
- **Cause**: API endpoint not returning successful response
- **Solution**: Check browser console for detailed error messages and verify API is working

### 3. Form Validation Issues
- **Cause**: Invalid data being submitted (e.g., non-numeric values in numeric fields)
- **Solution**: Ensure form fields contain valid data before submission

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive form validation
2. Implement better loading states for user feedback
3. Add success/error notifications
4. Implement pagination for large datasets
5. Add sorting and filtering capabilities
